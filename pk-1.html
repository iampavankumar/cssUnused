Business professionals as well as family members enter into business ventures on a regular basis.  This often involves multi-layered corporate structures. Many of the investors in these structures enter into shareholder or partnership agreements regarding buy-ins, buy-outs, operations, finance, and other relevant matters.  However, the documentation available as to foreign entities is often lacking in sufficient detail. While the inception documents are sufficient absent a dispute, matters become more complicates when a shareholder dispute arises.  This is particularly common with bare bones documentation. This problem becomes more sever in civil law jurisdictions, such as most of Latin America and Europe where the law applicable to such disputes is not extensive and complicates shareholder disputes and issues of that matter.
<h3><strong>MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL LITIGATION</strong></h3>
When disagreements within management and/or among shareholders arise, however, multi-jurisdictional litigation often is necessary to resolve the dispute.

Though these disputes can be costly, ACE Law is dedicated to assist you in resolving these disputes in the most efficient and expeditious matter possible.
