When you are party to a lawsuit in which you have the potential to obtain a financial judgement in your favor, or when you have already obtained such a judgement, you deserve to collect the award that the judge has granted. ACE Law is experienced in pursuing any and all possible pre and post judgement remedies to ensure that you are protected. Potential remedies in Florida include obtaining discovery for recovery, garnishment, attachment, lis pendens, seizure of assets, filing liens against property, and other remedies, depending on the facts in any particular case
<h3>PENDING LAWSUITS &amp; JUDGMENTS ENTERED</h3>
A party that has obtained a judgment or knows that a judgment is possible or likely against them often attempts to conceal or encumber their assets before the judgement occurs in order to prevent you from collecting that award. If you have a pending lawsuit or a judgment entered in the US or abroad, and you are worried that the opposing party may attempt to prevent you from collecting on the potential judgement, there are a number of pre-judgment and post-judgment remedies that ACE Law can assist you in seeking.

Similarly, there is a wide array of tools, such as garnishments, attachment and executions of real and personal property, that can be utilized when a judgement has already been obtained in your favor, but you are unable to realize a recovery of that award. These are known as post-judgement remedies. The foreign judgment is first recognized and then steps can be taken to recover on that judgment

<h3><strong>INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</strong></h3>
One of these remedies is injunctive relief. Injunctive relief is a court order asking someone to do something or forbidding some act. Common examples of injunctions include: Prohibitions against engaging in certain actives or taking certain acts; preventing irreparable damages or breach of contracts; enforcing contractual provisions; and enforcing the return or payment for unique items.
<h3><strong>TYPES OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</strong></h3>
The three main types of injunctive relief are temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and permanent injunctions. A temporary restraining order is a short-term injunction issued before a formal court hearing. These are usually issued when there is a danger that a delay in issuing an injunction will cause irreparable harm. A preliminary injunction, meanwhile, is a court order prohibiting a party or forcing a party from doing something in dispute until there is a final court judgment. Finally, a permanent injunction is a court order that a party cease certain activities permanently or perform certain acts.
