Economic torts, which are also called business torts, are torts that provide the common law rules on liability which arise out of business transactions.  For example, interference with economic or business relationships that are likely to involve pure economic loss is a situation that a business torts attorney is needed.  This encompasses torts and wrongful acts committed against business entities and individuals.  To the extent they are intentional in nature, they can sometimes be based on intentional, negligent or reckless conduct.

These torts are typically complex matters arising out of commercial relationships that involve detailed, multiparty contracts and a variety of legal issues.  This intention, reckless or negligent conduct generally will have caused or will cause some kind of financial loss. Business torts are not criminal offenses, although some business torts also may be charged as such. Businesses and individuals suffer financial damage through the intentional or neglectful act of another business, or agents thereof, allowing damaged parties to seek monetary damages in civil court. Sometimes courts will issue injunctions that order the defendant to cease specific unlawful activities.
<h3><strong>BUSINESS TORTS OVERVIEW</strong></h3>
Amongst other things, when damaging statements are made about a business, a financial loss is likely to occur.  In court, a final settlement or verdict is based upon, inter alia, future projections of that loss. For example, if the business lost a specific client due to another’s wrongful conduct, then losses are measured based on the financial worth of that relationship.  On the other hand, if the business tort affects the companies ability to attract new clients, then a more general claim for damages may be asserted. In the case that this has occurred, the plaintiff may attempt to reclaim profits believed to be lost in the future. This is but one example of the many business torts that exist.  If you believe you’ve been a victim of a business tort, please contact ACE Law firm.  Your Miami Business Torts attorneys.
